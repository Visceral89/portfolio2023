			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<h3>A bit about me</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a self-taught Frontend/Fullstack developer that is currently studying Frontend
				Development at IT Högskolan in Göteborg, Sweden. I love exploring areas where tech and
				artistry meet. With my previous work in E-commerce and education I have a keen sense for SEO
				and best practises on the web to create blazing fast designs that also capture the human
				element.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my freetime I experiment with new technologies and use the 3D models I create to make
				games. Please feel free to check out my Github to get a sense of what im working on
				currently.
